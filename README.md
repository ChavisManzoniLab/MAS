# MAS-PRT

Machine-automated scoring of Pup retrieval test

https://mas.readthedocs.io/

Mas is a pipeline allowing for an automatic scoring of pup retrieval test. It computes automatically multiple variables, including 

- Time to first encounter
- Time to retrieve the pup
- Distance
- Size of the Nest

More information in *DOI*

To work, Mas utilize a DeepLabCut detection of both the pup and the dam, and an automated detection of the Nest using Detectron2
